"""Pytest fixtures shared across the backend test suite.

The two big concerns are:

  1. The engagement / audit-log SQLite DB defaults to the user's real
     `~/Library/Application Support/HackingPal/engagements.db`. Tests
     must never touch it. The `temp_db` fixture redirects writes into
     `tmp_path` for the duration of one test and resets the cached
     connection between tests.

  2. Several routers read API keys from the OS keychain at import time.
     We don't import routers from the unit-test path here, but the
     keychain helpers are exercised indirectly via `_resolve_provider`
     in `routers/chat.py`. The default test environment has no keys,
     which matches a fresh-install user.
